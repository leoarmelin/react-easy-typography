# Motivation

**React-easy-typography is the result of wondering how we could create standarized typography components using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).** Focusing on the development experience and the end users, react-easy-typography is extremely easy to use, providing great results.

The author always wasted time building typography systems in every single project that he worked, **but no more!** We need to follow the guidelines from Google, Apple, or even internally from your job. Creating a typography system every single time is redundant.

Thus, react-easy-typography got created. **It's time to use complex typography systems with one unique tag ad its props.**
